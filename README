* Fixed an issue when moving cards from one pile to another. Before, the loop was set for when i < the size of the pile,
but since I was removing elements from the pile the loop did not go for as long as expected. I fixed this by setting
and int = to the length of the pile before removing any cards, so that the loop iterates for as long as necessary.

* Fixed an issue in my textual view where when there was only one row of cascade piles it would not print a new line.

* Fixed Javadoc for basic klondike.

* Made Enums their own class and got rid of redundant enum classes.

* Added parameters to legalMoveCascadePile. These extra parameters do not do anything in the abstract class's version
of the method, but allow the subclasses (specifically Whitehead klondike) to check the validity of moves without accessing
fields.

* Slightly changed isGameOver to check if their are legal moves left for any of the cards that are visible in the cascade pile.

* Abstracted tests to avoid code re-usage.
